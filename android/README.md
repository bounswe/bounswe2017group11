Android application of the project "Culturage"

### Getting Started

Although there are different ways to build an android application we will explain our (and actually Google's) preferred way.

### Built


After you set up the environment you can import out project. For this, first [download our repo as zip](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2017group11/archive/master.zip)
and unzip it to your workspace or clone it from
```
https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2017group11.git
```

then launch android studio, from the panel select Import Project (alternatively from File->New->Import Project)
then select <workspace> -> bounswe2017group11 -> android -> Culturage as the project

Gradle will take care of dependencies, some dependencies may need your approval to be downloaded android studio will warn you about this.

After gradle builds you can run the app on the emulator.
To be able to run it on a real device you need to enable developer options on your device.

Please follow these instructions found here:

```
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html
```

After accomplishing these, you can connect your device and run the app on it just like launching on emulator.
